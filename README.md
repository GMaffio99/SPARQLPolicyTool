# SPARQLPolicyTool

SPARQLPolicyTool is the project I realised for my IT engineering thesis entitled "Development of a tool for the application of policy to queries on SPARQL language and relative rewriting.

The aim of this Java tool is√ß
- to acquire queries in SPARQL language (the query language for data in RDF format)
- to get different types of constraints related to the usere that formulated the query
- to verify this constraints
- to return a modified and authorized query.
